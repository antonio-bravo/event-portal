    <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-200">If you cannot finish, or want to continue, make sure you fix the challenge, as you might need the code from the current challenge. The <code class="bg-gray-800 text-white rounded px-1 py-0.5">/fix</code> command will provide you with a branch, a Pull Request, and instructions to fix the challenge.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-200">If you are done, you can run <code class="bg-gray-800 text-white rounded px-1 py-0.5">/verify</code> to see if everything is correct.</p>

You can then merge the code to your main branch. Sometimes there are manual instructions you need to complete or a script you need to run to be able to fix it. After that, run the `/finish` command.

          <dd class="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-300">Global DevOps Experience is all about learning. And the best way to learn is from others. So we highly recommend working in teams. When you work as a team let one person be the driver and solve the challenges with each other. Switch drivers once in a while to let other people participate as well.</dd>

          <dd class="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-300">We want you to learn as much as possible. Because a day is short, and we have 6 great challenges for you, we give you a hint after 40 minutes that you can always move on by using the <code>/fix</code> command. This is not required, but merely a heads-up. We want you to see and experience it all!</dd>

      <div>

          <dd class="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-300">The <code>/fix</code> command actually creates a PR and a branch. After running the command, navigate to Pull Request and merge the changes and execute the proposed instructions.</dd>
